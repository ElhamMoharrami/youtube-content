# Mini Project Series, Code from the YouTube Channel


This repository contains the source code featured on my YouTube channel.
Right now I’m working on a series of small, practical projects you can explore, modify, and build on.

If there’s an app or project you’d like to see created, feel free to suggest it in the comments under the video.

Have a great time coding!
